# Time Series Forecasting for Communication Signals

## Overview
This repository contains my master's thesis work investigating the performance of deep time series forecasting models on communication signals affected by chromatic dispersion and timing jitter.

## Base Framework
This work is built upon the [Time-Series-Library (TSLib)](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) by THUML, Tsinghua University.
