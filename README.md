# Time Series Forecasting for Optical Communication Equalization

## Overview
This repository contains my master's thesis work benchmarking deep learning time-series models for optical communication equalization, with a focus on improved handling of chromatic dispersion and jitter effects. The research investigates how state-of-the-art time series forecasting models perform in the specialized domain of optical communication signal processing.

## Base Framework
This work is built upon the [Time-Series-Library (TSLib)](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), a comprehensive open-source library for deep time series analysis.

## My Research Contributions
# Primary Objectives

# Model Benchmarking: Systematic evaluation of deep learning time-series models for optical communication equalization
# Dispersion Compensation: Improved handling of chromatic dispersion effects in optical fiber transmission
# Jitter Mitigation: Enhanced compensation techniques for timing jitter in communication signals
# Performance Analysis: Comparative study of model effectiveness in communication-specific scenarios
